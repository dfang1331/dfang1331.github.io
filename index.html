      <section id="bio">
        <p> Christopher Maurice Brown is an American R&B singer, songwriter, and performer from Tappahannock, Virginia. He is currently thirty years of age but his career started all the way back in 2004 when he released his self-titled debut studio album Chris Brown. Since that release, Brown has gone on to drop nine more critically acclaimed albums cementing his legacy as one of the 21st century's most influential artists drawing comparisons to Michael Jackson for his popular hits and flashy dancing ability. His career isn't just limited to his music though. In 2007, he stepped into the world of acting with a role in the film "Stomp the Yard" and has gone on to shoot a number of other films including his own documentary which is available on Netflix. </p>

        <p>Regarding his personal life, Brown has been the subject of numberous controversies. Most notably, a 2009 domestic violence case regarding his girlfriend at the time Rihanna. Brown was charged with felony assault for the incident but in the end was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of counseling, and six months of community service. Brown and Rihanna got back together after the incident but their relationship was never the same after that. Nowadays with that incident in the rearview, Brown is now focused on continuing his music career and spending time with his daughter Royalty.
